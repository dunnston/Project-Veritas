## 🧪 Testing Your Migration

### **Integration Test**
Run the comprehensive test to verify everything works:

```gdscript
# Add IntegrationTestNode to your demo scene
var test_node = preload("res://scripts/test/IntegrationTestNode.gd").new()
get_tree().current_scene.add_child(test_node)
```

### **Manual Testing Checklist**
- [ ] Launch the project in Godot
- [ ] Check console for "System initialized" messages (should see 26+)
- [ ] Test inventory: InventorySystem.add_item("SCRAP_METAL", 10)
- [ ] Test equipment: Create and equip items
- [ ] Test building: Place structures in 3D space
- [ ] Test save/load: SaveManager.save_game()
